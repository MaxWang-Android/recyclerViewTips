A more software engineering way to deal with onItemClick event in RecyclerView

I've been recently started using recyclerview for my project, when dealing with function like 'OnItemClickedListener' of ListView, I searched a lot of ways but most of them are very complicated by implementing serveral listeners in and out RecyclerView, its adapter or its Activity. By reading android dev docs, I found a better way with less listeners and more intuitive.
